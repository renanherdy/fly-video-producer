-the app will produce videos from determinated source files that i choose
-i want to have some predefined templates that run on my files and give me a worked result
-i can mix some templates on same production, making a rich production
-i want sometimes to pause my production to continue from this state later
-i want to enter the app and see paused projects
-the app can give its shots of production without asking me, so i can start from a pre-worked job
-the app will ask me what the video need to be better
-i want to have full control on each point of edition and then come back to auto thing
-my video editor may include gps tracklog files so it can make animations from it
-my video editor can include generated information from the gps files
-i want to enter the app and see recent projects
-the video editor has to remember what it did on made productions
 -it will remember it on a set of instructions
 -we need to define some kinds of instructions because they have specific attributes
  -a kind of instruction will be the ffmpeg command
  -another kind is the template generated command
  -in the end all kinds will turn to ffmpeg command, gpsbabel, imagemagick. so we can have recursive instructions
  -to simplify, we can pass on instructions, simple class name, function name, and an array of parameters
 -another valuable thing to have is a group of instructions, this way, the project will be cleaner and organized
-so it is, a json with info about the project, and a list of groups of instructions
-this json can list the made output files, and give the chance to the user of skipping the step of production, utilizing previous made outputs, that are just files
-a instruction group can be converted to a template by the user
